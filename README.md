# 1 Pipe in component

if you use pipe in component, the memoization feature will be disabled.

i.e. if you add a pipe to the `providers` key like in `app1`.

# 2 import function or pipe

`import { multiply } from '../shared/pipes/multiply/multiply';` is ok.

    when `app2` and `app4` import it, webpack will compile it to `common.js`
    
# 3 use function or pipe

    it is always better to use pipe instead of function in HTML.

    pipe will cache the result, so it will not call the function again whenever the HTML re-render, if the pipe parameter do not change.

    so, if you want to make a function available in HTML:
    1. do not create a new variable like in `app2`.
    2. use pipe like in `app3`.

    if you only use the function in the component, then you do not need pipe.

# AngularServiceExample

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
